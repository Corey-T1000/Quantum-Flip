## Current Objective
QA workflow for terminal components

## Context
Ensuring terminal components are working correctly and maintaining code quality through automated testing.

## Completed Steps
1. Created comprehensive test suite for terminal components
2. Fixed timestamp formatting and validation
3. Improved style testing with emotion CSS classes
4. Added animation and layout tests
5. Verified component interactions

## Next Steps
1. Monitor terminal performance with large datasets
2. Consider adding visual regression tests
3. Add more edge case tests for error handling
4. Consider adding accessibility tests

## Implementation Details
- Using Jest and React Testing Library for component testing
- Testing emotion CSS-in-JS styles through class presence
