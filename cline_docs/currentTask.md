## Current Objective
Level progression QA completed

## Context
Comprehensive testing of the level progression system has been completed, verifying the game's difficulty scaling and state management.

## Implementation Status

1. Tutorial Levels (0-4)
   - ✓ Fixed 3x3 board size
   - ✓ Predefined patterns verified
   - ✓ Hint system integration confirmed
   - ✓ State management validated

2. Regular Levels (5+)
   - ✓ Dynamic board sizing verified
     * Level 5-9: 3x3
     * Level 10-14: 4x4
     * Level 15-19: 5x5
     * Level 20+: 6x6 (maximum)
   - ✓ Solution complexity scaling confirmed
     * Minimum moves: 3 + floor(level/5), capped at 6
     * Maximum moves: minMoves + 2, capped at 8
   - ✓ Hint charge system validated
     * Replenishes on new level
     * Properly tracks usage

3. Game State Management
   - ✓ Move counting accurate
   - ✓ Level transitions clean
   - ✓ Win conditions properly tracked
   - ✓ Hint state management verified

## Next Steps
1. Enhance tutorial system integration
2. Implement progressive hint system
3. Add visual feedback improvements
4. Develop strategic hint management
5. Enhance accessibility features

## Success Criteria
- ✓ Level progression verified
- ✓ Difficulty scaling confirmed
- ✓ State management validated
- ✓ Tutorial sequence tested
- ✓ Hint system integration checked

## Improvement Opportunities
1. Visual Feedback
   - Add level transition animations
   - Enhance win state celebration
   - Improve hint visualization

2. Tutorial Enhancement
   - Add level-specific guidance
   - Introduce mechanics gradually
   - Provide context-sensitive help

3. Accessibility
   - Add keyboard navigation
   - Implement screen reader support
   - Enhance visual contrast options
