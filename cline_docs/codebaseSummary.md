## Key Components
- GameBoard: Core game interface for quantum tile manipulation
- Terminal: Provides feedback and tutorial messages
- Settings: Manages user preferences and accessibility
- Audio: Handles sound effects and audio state

## Data Flow
1. Client sends tile interaction to GameBoard
2. GameBoard updates grid state via Redux
3. Terminal provides feedback on game state
4. Audio system responds to game events

## External Dependencies
- Web Audio API for sound processing
- Local Storage for game persistence
- React for UI rendering
- Redux for state management

## Recent Significant Changes
v1.0.0:

- Implemented tutorial system for new users
- Added sound effects for better feedback
- Created neumorphic design for visual appeal

## Code Organization
- src/components/: React components
- src/store/: Redux state management
- src/utils/: Game logic and utilities
- src/types/: TypeScript definitions

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for game logic
- Integration tests for Redux store
- Component tests for UI elements
- End-to-end tests for game flow
